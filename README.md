# Super Mecha Triad
A Triple Triad style game made with Typescript, PIXI and THREE. I started this as a personal project trying to make a game based on the same idea as Triple Triad but with mechas. Soon I realised that I'd spend the rest of my life doing assets for a card collecting game and I abandoned this idea to pursue a more affordable game type. 

Graphics and programming by me.
